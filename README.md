ENGLISH LANGUAGE:-

Database project for interesting words that I had to look up
- English UK-US differences
- Definitions of obscure words that people say to me

I'm going to write a simple program that can append to these CSVs.
I will use my program to manually digitise my lists of these.


FOREIGN LANGUAGES:-

I want to incorporate my digital and paper databases of
- Spanish
- Dutch

And finally portray interesting links between English, and these.
