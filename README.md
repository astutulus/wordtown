ENGLISH LANGUAGE:-

I want to maintain a CSV database of
 - English UK-US (differences between American and English words)
 - English Interesting words (ones I had to look up the meaning of)

I'm going to write a simple program that can append to these CSVs.
Then I will use my program, to digitise my various lists of these.
I aim to make a GUI to easily consult my database at any time.
Stretch goal is for the GUI to edit the database online.


FOREIGN LANGUAGES:-

I want to incorporate my digital and paper databases of
- Spanish
- Dutch

And finally portray interesting links between English, and these.
