ENGLISH LANGUAGE:-

Database project for interesting words that I had to look up
- Beginning with English UK-US differences
- Following with harder words and their definitions

I'm going to write a simple program that can append to these CSVs.
Then I will use my program, to digitise my various lists of these.
I aim to make a GUI to easily consult my database at any time.
Stretch goal is for the GUI to edit the database online.


FOREIGN LANGUAGES:-

I want to incorporate my digital and paper databases of
- Spanish
- Dutch

And finally portray interesting links between English, and these.
