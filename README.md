ENGLISH LANGUAGE:-

Database project for interesting words that I had to look up
    - English UK-US differences
    - Definitions of obscure words I heard

FOREIGN LANGUAGES:-

I want to incorporate my digital and paper databases of
    - Spanish
    - Dutch

And finally portray interesting links between English, and these.



My prototypical program edits lists of the above. 

Future functionality:

	(1) more robust input handling
	(2) ability to add more than one entry
	(3) ability to delete or even modify an entry
    (4) GUI
	(5) Stretch goal is GUI online.
