Language database project

ENGLISH LANGUAGE:-

    - English UK-US differences
    - Definitions of obscure words I read/heard, and had to look up 

FOREIGN LANGUAGES:-

I want to incorporate my digital and paper databases of
    - Spanish
    - Dutch

And finally portray interesting links between English, and these.


My prototypical program edits lists of the above. 

Future functionality:

	(1) more robust input handling
	(2) ability to read more than two columns
	(3) ability to delete or even modify an entry
	(4) GUI
	(5) Stretch goal is GUI online.
